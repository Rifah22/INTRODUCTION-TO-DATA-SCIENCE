Cancellation posts must cancel an individual for bigotry/ignorance. Corporations and movies are not people and do not count as individuals, and cancellations that deal with criminal investigations or sexual harassment/assault allegations are out of this subreddit's scope, but you may discuss them in Discussion posts. Cancelations must originate outside of this subreddit. Do not cancel celebrities who have an almost 100% right-leaning audience. It is pointless because exposing their bigotry will not cause them to lose any followers. The exception to this rule is if they lose something, such as a job or an award. Do not cancel politicians or people who have been dead for a long time. They are low hanging fruit. The exception to this rule is if the politician loses their job or if the politician is being canceled for something they did off the job. Do not cancel moderators of small subreddits. Canceled moderators must lean left. You may cancel any power moderator even if they only moderate politically neutral subreddits. The reasons for this rule are that canceling right-wing moderators will not cause them to lose followers and I do not want to make too many enemies from politically neutral subreddits.

DiscussionMy cancel story (self.CancelCulture) submitted 1 year ago by CYSYS8992 I was in a Discord server for a year and a half only to suddenly get banned out of nowhere permanently because it turned out others were complaining and reporting me behind my back the entire time, saying my posts were making them ""uncomfortable"". Granted, I did a few misbehaviors but I acknowledged them and vowed to improve myself after. But aside from those I wasn't breaking any rules or harassing anyone to begin with, I was just being myself and no less an active member there like everyone else, posting appropriate content in the appropriate channels. I wasn't even given a chance to say anything on the matter to appeal the ban or make any objections saying that all those reports were false or at least unproven. All it took was a bunch of people using the magic words ""makes me uncomfortable"" and I was automatically guilty thus needs to face punishment to the utmost degree, and the reports made about me are completely legit and justified. All this would've been avoided if the owner just rejected all those phony reports made about me because I wasn't blatantly rule-breaking or overall being a piece of shit. But no, even the owner was complicit in all this and simped for all those false reporters, saying they're in the right and my permanent unappealable ban is totally deserving and blocked me, destroying any chance of ever joining that server again. Naturally, I got angry at this display of sheer injustice and unfairness, of not only getting wrongly accused but also the owner still choosing to listen and believe those phony accusers without question and ban me anyway like they weren't; getting robbed of any future possible opportunities over just overall being myself as an individual, and the owner and presumably those same accusers had the gall to label me a narcissist who doesn't accept responsibility for his actions. TL;DR: I was wrongly banned from a server simply by being myself then was ironically labeled a narcissist when I got angry about it. Post a comment! [–]Speckyoulater 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago (1 child) What were your ""misbehaviors""? What'd they say you did that you don't think you did? [–]CYSYS8992[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago (0 children) I posted in the wrong channel and beat myself up over it. They never went into further detail on what I was getting banned over. [–]Global-Psychology376 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago (8 children) Or maybe you 'being yourself' makes people uncomfortable and you should try to change [–]CYSYS8992[S] 3 points4 points5 points 1 year ago (0 children) If something about 'myself' was making them uncomfortable and they told me about it I'd be willing to change that, but the only time they did was AFTER I got banned permanently. [–]CYSYS8992[S] 1 point2 points3 points 1 year ago (5 children) Unless a part of me being myself is obviously toxic and destructive, I doubt it. [–]strawberry_kerosene 1 point2 points3 points 11 months ago (2 children) keep being yourself ❤️ you aren't here to please anybody [–]CYSYS8992[S] 1 point2 points3 points 11 months ago* (1 child) The bigger issue is that those who are not pleased are somehow automatically in the right which I must accept without question. [–]strawberry_kerosene 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago (0 children) They're not in the right but go off bud [–]Global-Psychology376 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (1 child) You don't have to be toxic to make other people feel uncomfortable. A pair of pants doesn't have to completely stop your blood flow to feel uncomfortable. And It's completely reasonable to stop wearing uncomfortable pants and stop interacting with uncomfortable person [–]strawberry_kerosene 1 point2 points3 points 11 months ago (0 children) yeah so i should not be gay if it makes a hetero uncomfortable, i should quit using chewy.com if it makes people uncomfortable where i purchase food for my dog? no one is on Earth to please you. [–]PowerToDaPeople 0 points1 point2 points 9 months ago (0 children) Gay people kissing each other make me uncomfortable. According to your way of thinking I should cancel them? [–]FrostyLandscape 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (3 children) I tend to be blunt and that makes people uncomfortable. Were you telling the truth about things or clarifying you were just stating opinions? Some places online are toxic no matter what. I was in a group for parents and it quickly became toxic. They had certain people they would literally get ""text alerts"" when that person posted, so they could gang up on them. [–]CYSYS8992[S] 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (2 children) I don't know exactly. All they said was my posts were making them uncomfortable and that's it. They refused to elaborate any further. [–]strawberry_kerosene 1 point2 points3 points 11 months ago (0 children) did it include porn or sexual references, etc., were you shipping scavengers and dragons (you'll understand if you read WoF)? look back at your posts. if the answer is no to these then they're jerks. [–]FrostyLandscape 0 points1 point2 points 1 year ago (0 children) Pretty sure you can rejoin the server if you just get a new ISP which is easy to do. [–]justmikeplz 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago (3 children) I am sorry you got kicked off that Discord server. It clearly hurt you. The truth is, while we could/should all be ourselves, that doesn’t mean it comes without consequences. Some people are just naturally pleasant, without trying. Others have default personalities/behaviors/opinions that can bother others. Not everyone is supposed to fit in everywhere. When people look at themselves and strip away the bias, perhaps they can see what others see. The truth will still always be subjective, but it is normal in social and business groups for people to suppress some of their own undesirable traits/opinions in order to fit in. Everybody is doing it. Some people will have to do it more than others, but it is a price to pay in order to get something else that is valued or enjoyed. Also, sometimes these social pressures are great clues about things we can work on within ourselves. Of course, everyone has work to do, and not everyone is interested in adopting a mindset of continuous improvement. One thing for sure— sulking on the internet and being defensive about someone else you see as being defensive, is not continuous improvement. I suggest you stop obsessing, learn from your past and move on. You are probably missing out on life that is happening all around you. By the way, you seem to have indicated you knew there were probable issues before you got “canceled”. You made a choice to not change your behavior. You have no one to blame but yourself. That Discord server was nothing anyway. Here’s to a new life. I wish you all the best. [–]Anessor 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago (2 children) Yeah but what exactly got him banned? [–]justmikeplz 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago (1 child) If you read their account history, you can figure it out. [–]Anessor 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago (0 children) Not really, op just said he got banned for making people feel uncomfortable but he wasn’t told how, that’s literally why I’m asking [–]Lawdatory 0 points1 point2 points 11 months ago (1 child) I hate to have to ask but did your identity versus the complainers identity have anything to do with it? Ie are you white and they are nonwhite? Or vice versa? Are you hetero and they are queer? Are you a man and they are women?
